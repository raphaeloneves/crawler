# Crawler Playground

This project is able to connect into an specifc resource, resolve some captcha challanges, request a new challange until the expected results appears, and maintaining cookies and session data.
It was used in a job selection process with a specific URL as resource, so, I can't garantee that connection is working.

I developed it using JDK version 7 and JSoup.
